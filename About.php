<h1> Online Church Library Management System </h1>
<br>
<p align="left" style="font-size:160%">This system can let you search or browse the books and DVD's at your church library online or through smart phones. 
It is also a platform to create personal libraries for individuals to borrow books
from one another. <br>
<br>It is a free full-functioning online service that can record borrow/return activities, notify the availability
of reserved books, remind to return books when due, self-check out books if permitted, 
show activity statistics, procure and put new books on shelf, manage inventory and membership, and 
write reviews about the library, the borrowers, and books among many more functions.</p>
<br>
<p align="left" style="font-size:160%"> First two tabs on top are used for searching and adding churches and organizations in a dedicated directory. </p>
