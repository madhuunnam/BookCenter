<h1> Online Church Library Management System </h1>
<br>
<p align="left">This system can help you search or browse online (or through smart phones) the books and DVD's at your church library. It is also a platform for individuals to borrow books
particularly in Christianity from one another. It is a free full-functioning online service that can record borrow/return activities, notify the availability
of reserved books, remind to return books when due, self-check out books if permitted, 
show activity statistics, write reviews about the library, the borrowers, and books.</p>
<br>
<p align="left"> First two tabs on top are used for searching and adding churches and organizations in a dedicated directory </p>
